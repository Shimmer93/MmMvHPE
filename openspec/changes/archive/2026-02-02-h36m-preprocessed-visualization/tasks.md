## 1. Script Scaffold

- [x] 1.1 Create a new script under `scripts/` to load config/split/sample and build H36MMultiViewDataset
- [x] 1.2 Add CLI arguments for config path, split, sample index/count, and optional 2D key name

## 2. Visualization Outputs

- [x] 2.1 Implement multiview RGB overlay with 2D keypoints for the selected sample
- [x] 2.2 Render GT 3D skeleton alongside overlays for the same sample

## 3. Verification

- [x] 3.1 Run the script via `uv run` on the preprocessed dataset and confirm outputs are saved
