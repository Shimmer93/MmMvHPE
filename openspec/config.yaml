  Project: MMHPE (Multimodal Multiview Human Pose Estimation) using PyTorch Lightning.
  Goal: Train/evaluate human pose models that fuse RGB, depth, LiDAR, and mmWave to predict keypoints/SMPL.
  Environment: Use `uv` for dependencies; run Python via `uv run`. Do not auto-install packages.
  Prefer CUDA/GPU-enabled builds when applicable; update `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock` only when requested.
  Structure: configs/, datasets/, models/, losses/, metrics/, misc/, tools/, scripts/ (untracked), weights/logs/data (local).
  Documentation: Keep code comments brief; add lightweight docs under `docs/` when needed.
  Git: Only commit when explicitly asked.

# Project context (optional)
# This is shown to AI when creating artifacts.
# Add your tech stack, conventions, style guides, domain knowledge, etc.
# Example:
#   context: |
#     Tech stack: TypeScript, React, Node.js
#     We use conventional commits
#     Domain: e-commerce platform

# Per-artifact rules (optional)
# Add custom rules for specific artifacts.
# Example:
#   rules:
#     proposal:
#       - Keep proposals under 500 words
#       - Always include a "Non-goals" section
#     tasks:
#       - Break tasks into chunks of max 2 hours
rules:
  proposal:
    - Summarize impact on training/eval workflows and affected modalities.
  specs:
    - Reference existing repo structure (configs/, datasets/, models/, losses/, metrics/, misc/, tools/).
  design:
    - Note CUDA/GPU considerations and where compute-heavy logic lives.
  tasks:
    - Include `uv run` in command examples; do not add auto-install steps.
